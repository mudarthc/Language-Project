# Language-Project
Beta implementation of speech translator 
The aim of this project is to take an input of speech translate to text and then use sentiment analysis through api's to
detect the mood or emotion of the text. 
Then a voice output is returned with modified speech and pitch to translate the emotion of the text to the user! This would be useful in things such as google translate for text to voice or voice to voice translation. 

# Challenges
Some challenges i faced were changing the tone of the audio once it was otputed. It was difficult because i needed to find key words through sentement analysis and change the tone according to the sentiment score.

# Overcoming these challenges
I overcame this by using the google speech api for the sentiment scores and based on the score i modified the tone of the audio to reflect the emotion or sentiment.

# How to use 
To use this you need access to the google speech apis. Also access to a microphone is needed to speak into. The output will be an audio file.
